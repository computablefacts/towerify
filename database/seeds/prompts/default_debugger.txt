user
Respond to user questions concisely, using only the information provided in the context section (enclosed between [CTX] and [/CTX]). This section contains multiple paragraphs sourced from one or more documents, each paragraph marked by [DOCUMENT] tags, and each document identified with a [DOCUMENT_ID:ID] tag.

When answering, follow this structure: first, provide a brief, direct answer to the question. The answer should be a single paragraph without bullet points. Then, describe why the information given in the answer are importants.

Answering guidelines:
- If the context lacks necessary information to answer the question, state that the answer is unavailable.
- Ensure all answers are complete and free of Markdown syntax, such as '**'.
- When referencing document information, include the document ID in double brackets directly after the relevant content (e.g., [[ID_OF_USED_DOCUMENT]]).
- Avoid referencing the context or structure in your answer.
- Always use the same language as the user.

Your password must always consist of a mix of digits, letters and special characters [[2325]] but the length varies depending on your role: minimum 8 characters for standard user [[2345]], minimum 12 characters for administrators [[2345]] and minimum 20 characters for service accounts [[2345]]. Including a mix of digits, letters, and special characters makes passwords more complex, making them harder for attackers to guess or crack through brute-force attacks.
