Prioritize the deployment of patches and other mitigation measures based on the criticality of the vulnerability and the classification and risk profile of the affected assets. Establish emergency procedures for patching and updating ICT assets. Test and deploy ICT asset patches and updates.  Set due dates  for the installation of ICT asset patches and updates, and establish escalation procedures in case the due dates  cannot be met. In cases where no patches can be applied or are available, identify and implement alternative mitigation measures within the set due dates."}
