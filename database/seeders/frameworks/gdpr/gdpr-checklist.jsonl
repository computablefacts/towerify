{"page":1,"tags":["Lawful basis and transparency","Conduct an information audit to determine what information you process and who has access to it."],"text":"Organizations that have at least 250 employees or conduct higher-risk data processing are required to keep an up-to-date and detailed\u00a0list of their processing activities (article 30)\u00a0and be prepared to show that list to regulators upon request. The best way to demonstrate GDPR compliance is using a\u00a0data protection impact assessment (article 35).\nOrganizations with fewer than 250 employees should also conduct an assessment because it will make complying with the GDPR's other requirements easier. In your list, you should include: the purposes of the processing, what kind of data you process, who has access to it in your organization, any third parties (and where they are located) that have access, what you're doing to protect the data (e.g. encryption), and when you plan to erase it (if possible)."}
{"page":1,"tags":["Lawful basis and transparency","Have a legal justification for your data processing activities."],"text":"Processing of data is illegal under the GDPR unless you can justify it according to one of six conditions listed in\u00a0Article 6. There are other provisions related to children and special categories of personal data in\u00a0Articles 7-11. Review these provisions, choose a lawful basis for processing, and document your rationale. Note that if you choose \"consent\" as your lawful basis, there are\u00a0extra obligations, including giving data subjects the ongoing opportunity to revoke consent. If \"legitimate interests\" is your lawful basis, you must be able to demonstrate you have conducted a privacy impact assessment."}
{"page":1,"tags":["Lawful basis and transparency","Provide clear information about your data processing and legal justification in your privacy policy."],"text":"You need to tell people that you're collecting their data and why (Article 12). You should explain how the data is processed, who has access to it, and how you're keeping it safe. This information should be included in your privacy policy and provided to data subjects at the time you collect their data. It must be presented \"in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child.\""}
{"page":1,"tags":["Data security","Take data protection into account at all times, from the moment you begin developing a product to each time you process data."],"text":"You must follow the principles of \"data protection by design and by default,\" including implementing \"appropriate technical and organizational measures\" to protect data. In other words, data protection is something you now have to consider whenever you do anything with other people's personal data. You also need to make sure any processing of personal data adheres to the data protection principles outlined in\u00a0Article 5. Technical measures include encryption, and organizational measures are things like limiting the amount of personal data you collect or deleting data you no longer need. The point is that it needs to be something you and your employees are always aware of."}
{"page":1,"tags":["Data security","Encrypt, pseudonymize, or anonymize personal data wherever possible."],"text":"Most of the productivity tools used by businesses are now available with\u00a0end-to-end encryption\u00a0built in, including email, messaging, notes, and cloud storage. The GDPR requires organizations to\u00a0use encryption or pseudeonymization\u00a0whenever feasible."}
{"page":1,"tags":["Data security","Create an internal security policy for your team members, and build awareness about data protection."],"text":"Even if your technical security is strong,\u00a0operational security\u00a0can still be a weak link. Create a security policy that ensures your team members are knowledgeable about data security. It should include guidance about email security, passwords, two-factor authentication, device encryption, and\u00a0VPNs. Employees who have access to personal data and non-technical employees should receive extra training in the requirements of the GDPR."}
{"page":1,"tags":["Data security","Know when to conduct a data protection impact assessment, and have a process in place to carry it out."],"text":"A\u00a0data protection impact assessment\u00a0(aka privacy impact assessment) is a way to help you understand how your product or service could jeopardize your customers' data, as well as how to minimize those risks. The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has a data protection impact assessment checklist on its website. The GDPR requires organizations to carry out this kind of analysis whenever they plan to use people's data in such a way that it's \"likely to result in a high risk to [their] rights and freedoms.\" The ICO recommends just doing it anytime you're about to process personal data."}

A list of many of the EU member states supervisory authorities can be found here. The GDPR does not specify whom you should notify if you are not an EU-based organization. For those in English-speaking non-EU countries, you may find it easiest to notify the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland. You are also required to quickly\u00a0communicate data breaches to your data subjects\u00a0unless the breach is unlikely to put them at risk (for instance, if the stolen data is encrypted)."}
{"page":1,"tags":["Accountability and governance","Designate someone responsible for ensuring GDPR compliance across your organization."],"text":"Another part of \"data protection by design and by default\" (article 25) is making sure someone in your organization is accountable for GDPR compliance.

{"page":1,"tags":["Accountability and governance","If your organization is outside the EU, appoint a representative within one of the EU member states."],"text":"If you process data relating to people in one particular member state, you need to appoint a representative in that country who can communicate on your behalf with data protection authorities. The GDPR and its official supporting documents do not give guidance for situations where processing affects EU individuals across multiple member states. Until this requirement is interpreted, it may be prudent to designate a representative in a member state that uses your language. Some organizations, like public bodies, are not required to appoint a representative in the EU."}
{"page":1,"tags":["Accountability and governance","Appoint a Data Protection Officer (if necessary)"],"text":"There are three circumstances in which organizations are required to have a\u00a0Data Protection Officer\u00a0(DPO), but it's not a bad idea to have one even if the rule doesn't apply to you. The DPO should be an expert on data protection whose job is to monitor GDPR compliance, assess data protection risks, advise on data protection impact assessments, and cooperate with regulators."}

You must notify the data subject before you begin processing their data again."}

You need to make it easy for people to request human intervention, to weigh in on decisions, and to challenge decisions you've already made."}
