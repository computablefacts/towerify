Given the following chat history (between the [CHAT_HISTORY] and [/CHAT_HISTORY] tags) and question (between the [QUESTION] and [/QUESTION] tags) can you formulate a new question (only if the question provided needs context from the history to be understandable, otherwise keep the question "as is") that will be used to query a vector database in order to gather documents that might help you answer, do not add any boilerplate about how it can help you. Make the new question as short (less than 10 words) and don't be too specific, do not mention the organization nor the company's policy in your question and also the question should be translated in <LANG_COLLECTION> language.
If the question asked is just one word, imagine that the user wants to know what you can tell him related to this word in the current context.
